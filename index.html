		<p> Landau was a journalist and record producer before meeting Springsteen, and his work with Springsteen has extended into the recording studio: He is credited as a co-producer of every Springsteen album from 1975 to 1995, except for Nebraska. He also has worked on important records besides Springsteen’s (Jackson Browne’s The Pretender, MC5’s Back in the USA) and managed Shania Twain, Natalie Merchant, Alejandro Escovedo and others.</p>

<p>But his career is defined by his work with the artist of whom he famously wrote, in a 1974 concert review, “I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen.”</p>

<p>Presumably, Springsteen will handle the induction speech at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony, which takes place May 2 in Cleveland. But he already has put his thoughts and feelings about Landau into words, devoting a chapter of his 2016 book “Born to Run” to him.</p>

<p>Springsteen describes Landau as “the Clark to my Lewis” and says he had had an “instant chemical connection” with him and “the same kind of intense connection” that he had with Steven Van Zandt. But it was different, he writes, because Springsteen was still “a young and developing musician,” when he met Landau, and Landau, though only two years older, had a certain kind of knowledge that Springsteen craved.</p>

<p>“I was interested in forefathers, artist brothers in arms, people who’d thought like this who’d come before me,” Springsteen writes. “Jon knew who and where they were, in books, in films and in music.”</p>

<p>Landau also had an almost immediate impact on Springsteen’s sound. “He guarded against overplaying and guided (Born to Run) toward a more streamlined sound,” Springsteen writes, “I was ready to give up some eclecticness and looseness, some of the street party, for a tighter punch to the gut.”</p>

<p>He describes Landau as a father figure, and also reveals they had some rough moments in the ’90s, when Landau started working with other artists, as well, after being intensely focused on Springsteen.</p>

<p>Springsteen writes, in the chapter, of iconic musicians who have died young (Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, Janis Joplin etc.) and credits Landau with looking out for his long-term happiness and well-being. Crucially, Landau steered Springsteen toward him towards psychotherapy, to deal with his depression.</p>

<p>“In New Jersey, in my crowd, the psychiatric profession might as well not have existed,” Springsteen writes. “When I looked down and saw bottom, Jon assisted me toward help that would refocus and alter the course of my life. I owe a great debt to my friend for his kindness, generosity and love. He’s done a pretty nice job of management too.” </p>

				  <h3>Bruce Springsteen on the cover of Time and Newsweek in October of 1975</h3>
				 <p>On Oct. 27, 1975, Bruce Springsteen made history by becoming the first rock star to land on the cover of Time and Newsweek in the same week. The articles were written in response to the breakthrough success of Born to Run, which had been released two months earlier and had peaked at No. 3 in the weeks preceding the cover stories.</p>
					 
				 <p>According to Peter Ames Carlin’s 2012 biography, Bruce, it wasn’t a coincidence. Jay Cocks of Time found out that Maureen Orth of Newsweek was doing a piece about Springsteen and convinced his editor that they were about to be one-upped by their chief competitor.</p>
				 
				 <p>The magazines were each granted interviews with Springsteen. Although they both featured similar details about his background and newfound stardom after his first two albums failed, the two articles were strikingly different in tone.</p>
				 
				 <p>Cocks, a big Springsteen fan, wrote a piece called "Rock’s New Sensation" in which he heaped praise on the new star. “His music is primal,” he wrote. “Directly in touch with all the impulses of wild humor and glancing melancholy, street tragedy and punk anarchy that have made rock the distinctive voice of a generation … Everybody is going to know where he's coming from and just where he's heading.”</p>
				 
				 <p>However, Newsweek took the angle that Springsteen’s success was not only the result of his talent but also due to what Joni Mitchell called the “starmaker machinery behind the popular song.” Their story, titled "The Making of a Rock Star," looked at Columbia Records’ marketing campaign for ‘Born to Run’ and concluded, “Hypes are as American as Coca-Cola so perhaps -- in one way or another -- Bruce Springsteen ‘is’ the Real Thing.”</p>
				 
				 <p>In Carlin’s book, Orth defended her story. “I felt like I needed to report the story out, It’s balanced, just not worshipful. I was finding out stuff that made me think that this kid was getting batted around. An innocent kid who was shy and maybe not so sophisticated at that point. Who was thinking of Bruce?”
				 </p>
				 
				 <p>Even though Springsteen consented to the publicity, he was nonetheless worried about the possibility of it backfiring. Still, at his concert at Michigan State University on April 4, 1976, Springsteen acknowledged the positive impact being on both covers had on his career. During the requisite performance of "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)," he changed the lyrics in the bridge to "Tell him now it’s his last chance, Rosie / Tell him I ain’t no freak / ‘Cause I got my picture / On the cover of Time and Newsweek!"</p>
